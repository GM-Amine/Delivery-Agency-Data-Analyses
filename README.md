# Delivery Agency Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes delivery agency performance across different wilayas.
The goal was to understand whether delivery success and return rates are
related to population density and the number of communes per wilaya.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning (Python)
- Handled missing values
- Corrected corrupted and inconsistent entries
- Created delivery and return ratios
- Aggregated data at wilaya level

## 📊 Visualization (Power BI)
- Built an interactive dashboard showing:
  - Delivered vs returned ratios
  - Population density by wilaya
  - Number of communes per wilaya
  - Geographic comparison across regions

## 📈 Statistical Analysis
- Performed correlation testing between:
  - Delivery/return ratios
  - Population density
  - Number of communes
- Identified patterns and weak-to-moderate relationships

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, seaborn)
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook
